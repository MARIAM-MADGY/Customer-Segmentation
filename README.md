# 📊 Customer Segmentation  

This project applies **Unsupervised Learning** techniques to group customers into meaningful segments based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  

## 🔍 What I Did  
- Used the **Mall Customers Dataset** (Kaggle).  
- Performed preprocessing and **feature scaling**.  
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- Implemented **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers.  
- Visualized the clusters in 2D for better interpretation.  
- Analyzed the behavior of each cluster based on income and spending.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms such as **DBSCAN**.  
- Perform a deeper analysis by calculating **average spending per cluster**.  
- Try incorporating more features to improve segmentation.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: clustering and preprocessing
